This program reads ID numbers from a file and then assigns them to a student object. Depending
on the number of students, a DoubleLinkedList (for number of students less than 1000) or an AVL tree is created for the students. The
IDs are assigned as the keys and are ordered as such from the lower bound to the upper. Both the AVL tree and
DoubleLinkedList are created from scrath. 

The goal of this program is to test an AVL tree versus a DoubleLinkedList
